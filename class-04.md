# Class Notes


variables are values stored for later use.
functions are blocks of code stored for later use.

`function` + `name of function()` { This is the call or invoking of a function

}

Below is the code that stores the funtion
`function sayHello(){
  console.log('hello');
}`

The code above is then called below
`sayhello();`

Anything inside the `()` is the parameter or argument 

`function makeFullName(firstname, lastname){
  var fullName = firstName, lastName;
  return fullName;
  console.log(fullName)
}`

The Parameter DOES NOT have to be declared as a variable before being used inside a function. You are technically declaring it when you put it in as a parameter.
